## Discussing the impact of emotional labour on teachers based on interactive devices

This project aims to explore and visualise the emotional labour of teachers. In their daily teaching work, teachers not only need to impart knowledge, but also need to perform a great deal of emotional labour. This emotional labour has a profound impact on students' learning and psychological state, and also plays an important role in teachers' own mental health. Teachers face multiple potential pressures and often need to manage their own emotions to meet the feelings of others. This process is often invisible, but its importance should not be overlooked.

The inspiration comes from a common phenomenon in everyday life: the refraction of sunlight as it passes through glass. This refraction of light needs to be adapted and adjusted in different mediums, just as teachers do in their emotional labour. Emotional labour is a process of absorbing external stimuli and generating feedback accordingly.
